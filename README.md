# photo_match_find
This program used to find various versions (size modified) of same images (photos) that are lost due the usage of social media platforms for e.g. WhatsApp. Some times we used to end up saving the same photo in various locations from various sources from computer, mobile local storage & from Social media backups. And we may want to find out the duplicates that are stored in various locations (in computer only) to avoid duplication. To find out the duplicates in a location, the user may need to copy this python script in the required location & run it from there. Before run, the user may need to make sure that all dependancies are installed in the system in which you're going to run and also this script is written to run in linux environment. Ofcourse a small tweek might make this script to work in windows as well that I leave to you. Read the detailed help strings written inside (start of) the script itself to 'how to use'.
